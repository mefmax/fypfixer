✅ Backend: Python 3.11+, PostgreSQL, Flask
✅ Database: PostgreSQL 14+ (Supabase ready)
✅ Docker: Dockerfile provided

URLs:
- Local Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Local Backend: http://localhost:8000/api
- Production: TBD

TEAM NOTES

Frontend Developer:
- Successfully migrated all V0 designs
- Implemented complete onboarding flow
- All components are production-ready
- TypeScript types are complete

Backend Developer:
- Implemented full REST API
- Database seeding ready
- JWT authentication working
- Docker configuration complete

RISKS & MITIGATION
------------------

Risk: V0 designs might change
Mitigation: watch-v0.ps1 script for easy updates

Risk: Backend performance under load
Mitigation: Need load testing before production

Risk: User confusion in onboarding
Mitigation: Clear copy and visual feedback at each step

CONCLUSION
----------

The project is in excellent shape for MVP launch. All core features
are implemented, tested locally, and ready for staging deployment.

The onboarding flow provides a smooth user experience from landing
to first value (seeing their personalized dashboard).

Recommended: Proceed with user testing this week, address feedback,
and prepare for staging deployment next week.
